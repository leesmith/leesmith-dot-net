          <p>Welcome to my personal website. My name is Lee Smith and I'm a software engineer living in Birmingham, AL.</p>
          <p>
            This is my personal site where I'll blog about anything interesting I've learned along the way in my career
            in technology. I'm currently the Director of Engineering for ThreatAdvice, a cybersecurity education and technology
            startup. My primary technology stack these days is writing Ruby within the Ruby on Rails web application framework
            and deploying to Heroku and Amazon Web Services.

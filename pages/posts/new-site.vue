        So I'm finally publishing a personal blog! I know...I should have been doing this a long time ago. I don't know what made me check on the availability but
        this domain wasn't registered so I pulled the trigger. Finally - a domain name I don't hate! But that's a terrible reason to not blog but oh well.
        Now I'm on it!</p>
      <p>
        I built this site using <a href="http://nuxtjs.org" target="_blank">Nuxt</a>. It's a completely static site, generated from Nuxt and I'm really digging
        it. I've also deployed it to Amazon S3. I'll probably be writing a bit about Nuxt and Vue here at first since I'm really enjoying learning these newer
        frontend frameworks. Anyway, thanks for stopping by!
